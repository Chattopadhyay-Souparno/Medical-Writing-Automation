Combined methodology Summary from articles extracted using nested TextRank Algorithm:Available Scr values were used to identify episodes of AKI, defined according to the KDIGO criteria as increase in Scr of ≥26.5 µmol/L within 2.0 days or ≥1.5 times baseline within 7 days.15 Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS .Stone recurrence was defined as detection of a stone in patients previously shown to be stone-free by imaging study.assayR_Oform oxcCGTGTTGTTCGTGACGGAAOxalotrophic bacteria 15frc171_FCTSTAYTTCACSATGCTSAAC135Foramplicon library generation and qPCR assayfrc306_RGDSAAGCCCATVCGRTCOpen in a separate window Other analyses on 16S amplicon dataEffect of hyperoxaluric condition on microbial interactions were assessed using network analysis of co-occurrence and co-exclusion as described before29.For subject characterization, 24 h urine and surgically removed kidney stone samples were utilized for oxalate quantification and chemical analysis respectively; while the fecal samples were used for bacterial diversity and targeted metagenomic analysis.We further summarised risk of bias across domains for each outcome in each included study, as well as across studies and domains for each outcome, in accordance with the approach for summary assessments of risk of bias presented in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions .Measures of treatment effect We expressed dichotomous data as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals .Ifwe identified cross‐over trials, cluster‐randomised trials, or trials with more than two intervention groups for inclusion in the review, we handled these in accordance with guidance provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions .Dealing with missing data We obtained missing data from study authors, if feasible, and performed intention‐to‐treat analyses if data were available.Design and Study SelectionWe conducted this systematic review using an internal prespecified protocol and reported this review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement .17We included studies that met the following eligibility criteria: published English language full-text articles and conference proceedings;any study design; at least 2 patients with ADPKD included in the study, with and without a comparator group, and described any efficacy or safety outcome following at least any one of SWL, ureteroscopy, and/or PCNL in adults with ADPKD and kidney stones.Ureteral stricture Quality of lifePostoperative hospital admissionWe had initially planned to assess the outcome of narcotic requirements in morphine equivalents as per our protocol , but we revised this to requirement for narcotics .Method and timing of outcome measurement We assessed postoperative discomfort based on information captured by visual analogue scales .We included outcome data up to three months after randomisation for all outcomes except ureteral stricture formation; for this outcome, we also considered longer‐term data when available.To calculate any statistically significant difference of continuous independent variables like age, serum calcium within the control and patient groups, we used Student t-test
